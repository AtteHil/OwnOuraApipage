# **Fullstack Development Training Project**
Overview
This project aims to enhance my fullstack development skills through the creation of a dynamic web page. The server component retrieves data from the Oura API, utilizing a personal access token obtained here. The acquired data is then stored in a MongoDB database, serving as the foundation for subsequent retrieval and display.

# Features
Data Retrieval: The server fetches data from the Oura API using the user's personal access token.
Database Integration: The retrieved data is stored in a MongoDB database for efficient management.
Data Visualization (Future Implementation): Charts will be incorporated to visually represent even more precise statistics derived from the stored data.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js version 18 or newer is required.
Ensure MongoDB is running at https://127.0.0.1:27017.
Installation
Fork the repository.
Run npm install to install all necessary modules.
```
npm install
```
Running the Server
Execute the following command  to start the server.""
```
node ./bin/www
```


# Accessing the Site
Once the server is running, the site can be accessed at localhost:3000.

# Notes
Make sure to obtain and use a valid personal access token from the Oura API.
Ensure the MongoDB database is running at the specified address.
Future Enhancements
Future updates will include the integration of more precise charts with more options to provide insightful visualizations of the collected data.
